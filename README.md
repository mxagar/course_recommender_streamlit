# Deployment of an AI Course Recommender System Using Streamlit

This project implements and deploys an AI course Recommender System using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

This project was inspired by the the [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) offered by IBM & Coursera. In the last course/module of the Specialization, Machine Learning Capstone, a similar application is built; check my [class notes](https://github.com/mxagar/machine_learning_ibm/tree/main/06_Capstone_Project) for more information.
